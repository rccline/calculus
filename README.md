Frank & Sprecher's book contains material for a basic three-semester calculus course.  Particularly helpful for beginning calculus students is all of the necessary introductory and review material is contained in Chapter 1.  There is an instructor's manual to accompany this book:  *Instructor's manual to accompany Calculus and analytic geometry* Unknown Binding â€“ January 1, 1975
by Peter Frank (Author).  The instructor's manual is listed on *Amazon.com* but is currently unavailable.
